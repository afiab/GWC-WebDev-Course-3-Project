  <h2> Possible Solutions </h2>

  <!--Note: Most of these suggestions are based on personal observations and discussions with peers. -->

  <h3>Earlier Exposure to Computer Science</h3>
  <p>Providing opportunities for young girls to engage with computer science at an early age can create interest in the field. This can be done through programs, workshops, and initiatives that promote coding, robotics, and other STEM-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Creating an Inclusive Environment</h3>
  <p>Establishing inclusive school and work spaces is crucial. Encouraging diversity and equal representation, addressing bias and stereotypes, and fostering a culture of inclusion can attract and retain more women in computer science.</p>

  <h3>Mentorship and Role Models</h3>
  <p>Mentoring programs and access to successful women in computer science can provide guidance, inspiration, and networking opportunities for aspiring female professionals. Visible role models help challenge gender stereotypes and demonstrate that women can excel in the field.</p>

  <h3>Changing Curriculums</h3>
  <p>Updating computer science curriculum to be more inclusive and relevant can attract a broader range of students, including girls. Emphasizing real-world applications and group projects can make computer science more appealing and accessible.</p>
